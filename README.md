This branch is for the final team project for 'DATS 6101.10- Introduction to Data Science' course. 
We have worked on Pizza Sales Data for the midterm project and we are going to use the same data set for the final project and try to apply the concepts we learnt in the second half of the semester to answer a few SMART questions for our project.
